**Keywords:** Crime, Crime Classification, Crime trends, Crime Rate.

**Description:** Crime analytics is a data driven project aimed to improve public safety and law enforcement by data analysis. This Project uses open data primarily sourced at https://data.gov/ the house of the US government's open data intended to public use. This project includes analysing crime trends, classifing different type of crimes. The primary data source will be updated on regular basis(mostly weekly/daily) as of 10/30/2023 the data set is updated on 10/29/2023.

**Research Questions:**
RO1: To determine how crime patterns/trens in chicago have changes over the years
RO2: To preduct the total number of crimes in chicago for coming years based on previous trends
RO3: To defend the use of a linear regression model for performing the prediction in RO2 by testing its assumptions of linearity.
RO4: To analyze the predictive model for its ability to unveil significant relationships and patterns within the crime data, and potential limitations.



**Intellectual Merit:**
Crime Analytics has alot of potential in the field of criminology, public safety and data science.This analysis helps in determining the trends/patterns in crimes and possible cause of crimes. Identifing the crime hotspots helps in urban planing and resource allocation and possible crime predection. Classsifing crimes into different categories helps in creating crime topology that helps in determining crime behaviour.

**Data Sourcing:** This project is completly depends on realiability of the data set so im using datasets published by aggencies across the federal governments in Data.gov a trusted government provided open data to the public,The primary data source will be updated on regular basis(mostly weekly/daily) as of 10/30/2023 the datasets are updated on 10/29/2023.

**Background Knowledge:** Crime analysis is the process of using data to help police improve public safety and law enforcement. It can help police identify crime patterns, trends, problems, suspects, offenders, and prevention strategies [1][2]. Crime analysts need to have a combination of skills and knowledge in areas such as criminology, criminal justice, research methods, statistics, data analysis, GIS, computer applications, communication, and problem solving. Crime analysts also need to adhere to ethical standards and principles in their work [3].

**Related Work:**

After research, I felt the following papers most relevant to my project. 

1.Book  "Analysis of Crime Report by Data Analytics Using Python" by G. Maria Jones and Godfrey. In this book the authors implement machine learning techniques in real time data analysis by means of Python.
 
2. "Identifying High Risk Crime Areas using Topology" by Richard Frank which explains the pattern modelling approach to identify the concentrations of crimes and how topology is useful for crime analysis. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5484782

3.Crime analysis with crime mapping by rachel boba santosh clearly discuss about crime analysis process, purpose, tactics. https://shorturl.at/rEH08

This is also one of the most recommended book for crime analytics and mapping.
