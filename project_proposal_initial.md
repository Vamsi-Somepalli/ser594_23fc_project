Description: Crime analytics is a data driven project aimed to improve public safety and law enforcement by data analysis. This Project uses open data primarily sourced at https://data.gov/ (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-2001-to-present) the house of the US government's open data intended to public use. This project includes analysing crime trends, classifing different type of crimes. The primary data source will be updated on regular basis(mostly weekly/daily) as of 9/11/2023 the data set is updated on 9/8/2023.

Intellectual Merit: Crime Analytics has alot of potential in the field of criminology, public safety and data science.This analysis helps in determining the trends/patterns in crimes and possible cause of crimes. Identifing the crime hotspots helps in urban planing and resource allocation and possible crime predection. Classsifing crimes into different categories helps in creating crime topology that helps in determining crime behaviour.

Data Sourcing: This project is completly depends on realiability of the data set so im using datasets published by aggencies across the federal governments in Data.gov a trusted government provided open data to the public,The primary data source will be updated on regular basis(mostly weekly/daily) as of 9/11/2023 the datasets are updated on 9/8/2023. 

Background Knowledge: Due to the increase in crimes now-a-days, i came up with a thought of analysing the crime data and finding the reasons, causes and the areas with highest crime rate.
With this idea I have researched on google for blogs related to crime analysis, google scholar for crime realted research papers to understand about the different approaches they have followed and sci-hub website to access some of the research papers other than the one's listed in google scholar. On top of this I have also read few articles related to crime data and chose data.gov to get the reliable crime data

Related Work: After research, I felt the following papers most relevant to my project. Book 1 "Analysis of Crime Report by Data Analytics Using Python" by G. Maria Jones and Godfrey. In this book the authors implement machine learning techniques in real time data analysis by means of Python.
The second one is an IEE paper "Identifying High Risk Crime Areas
using Topology" by Richard Frank which explains the pattern modelling approach to identify the concentrations of crimes and how topology is useful for crime analysis.
